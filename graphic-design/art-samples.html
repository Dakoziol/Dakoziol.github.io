        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but I’ve since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.</p>

            <h2>Art Samples</h2>
            <p>A lot of my time in this class was spent on layout for posters, letters, brochures and things like that but unfortunately, I don’t have any of those anymore. I still have my best art though, mostly vector art but some of them were made in Photoshop. All of these pieces I either did in my free time or as part of a loosely defined assignment&mdash;no step-by-step assignments in here.</p>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Misty Mountains.</b> Photoshop. This was a homework project, I was assigned to draw a cabin by a lake with mountains. As you can see I forgot the lake, but I think it turned out pretty well regardless.</figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Impossibly Possible Tower.</b> Illustrator. This isometric illustration was inspired by the game <em>Monument Valley</em>.</figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Perspective.</b> Illustrator. I was further messing with isometric art when I ended up with these four jagged lines. They were reminicent of a building, but it was sort of tricky&mdash;like it had two perspectives at once. So I ran with it.</figcaption>
            </figure>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Phone Concept.</b> Illustrator. I spent a lot of time on this one. Maybe too much. It's all separated cleanly into layers: hardware, software, and shadows, and within software it's divided further into the status bar, weather widget, and so forth.</figcaption>
            </figure>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Most of a Sunrise.</b> Illustrator. This was a homework project where I was assigned to recreate a photo, which I had taken a few weeks earlier.</figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Satellites.</b> Illustrator. This is one of my favorite illustrations of mine. It somehow feels huge and small at the same time.</figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Pretty Scene.</b> Illustrator. This is just a quick illustration I did to play with color.</figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>Slope.</b> Illustrator. Again, just a quick illustration experimenting with color and light.</figcaption>

                </a>
                <figcaption><b>The Snow Man.</b> Photoshop. That snowman is definitely up to something. This piece was designed in Photoshop and exported as an STL file to be 3D printed as a keychain. It's made up of two layers: The diagonal lines in the background, and the art, text, and border in the foreground, which I darkened with black paint.</figcaption>
            </figure>
