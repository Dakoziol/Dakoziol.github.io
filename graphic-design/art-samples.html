        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley, Idaho. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but Iâ€™ve since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.</p>

            <h2>Infographic</h2>
            <p>For the technical communications course at ISU, I was tasked to create an infographic explaining some idea or process. I'm into physics stuff so I thought that I'd try to exlain Archimedes' Principle in a clear and understandable way.</p>

            <h2>Art Samples</h2>
            <p>A lot of my time in the Graphics Communications program was spent on layout for posters, letters, and brochures. Unfortunately, I don't have any of that work anymore, but I still have my best art, mostly vector art but some of them were made in Photoshop. All of these pieces I either did in my free time or as part of a broadly defined assignment&mdash;no step-by-step assignments in here.</p>

                <figcaption><b>Perspective.</b> Illustrator. I was further messing with isometric art when I ended up with these four jagged lines. They were reminicent of a building, but it was sort of tricky&mdash;like it had two perspectives at once. So I ran with it.</figcaption>

                <figcaption><b>Phone Concept.</b> Illustrator. I spent a lot of time on this one. Maybe too much. It's all separated cleanly into layers: hardware, software, and shadows, and within software it's divided further into the status bar, weather widget, and so forth.</figcaption>

It's made up of two layers: The diagonal lines in the background, and the art, text, and border in the foreground, which I darkened with black paint. I think he's charming, albiet suspicious.</figcaption>

            <h2>Video Game Concept Art</h2>
            <p>I do some game dev, just as a hobbyist. Most of this art is for one game, <em>Kayak-o-Rama!</em></p>
            <p>The art of the <em>Kayak-O-Rama!</em> is inspired by vintage travel posters, hence the paper-like appearance in-game, and adventurous, eerily optimistic tone overall that I was going for. The terrain in every level consists of a stretch of water and its immediate ground, objects, and vegitation&mdash;all that a kayaker would see anyway. Everything's on a black background, which I think makes for a cool contrast especially on OLED displays.</p>

                <figcaption>This is a banner concept I came up with. It's only half finished, but I think it captures the vibe I'm going for so far: adventurous and intense, yet sort-of glammorous and prestegious.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This is the jungle terrain, the concept art that I've based the game on so far. It's also the cleanest looking terrain in my opinion.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This is the archipelogo terrain. It's wide and there's no flowing water, so it's a lot different from the other concepts. It would probably need something else to make it interesting. Sharks?</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This is the pine forest terrain. The stream is narrow and rocky, treacherous in it's own right. Those are supposed to be pine trees; hopefully that'll be more obvious when they have parallax in-game.</figcaption>
