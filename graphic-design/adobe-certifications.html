        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but I’ve since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.</p>

            <h2>Adobe Certifications</h2>
            <p>Before I graduated, I got certified in both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I think we took the CC 2015 versions because that was what we started on, but I was using CC 2018 when I took those tests.</p>
