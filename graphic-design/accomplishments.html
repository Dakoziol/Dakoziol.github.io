        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley, Idaho. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but I’ve since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>This class is where I won bronze in the 2018 SkillsUSA Idaho banner contest and designed the CRTC logo they printed on shirts and keychains that year. Unfortunately, I don’t have either of the original pieces anymore, but I still have the bronze medal, a keychain, and a shirt.</p>
