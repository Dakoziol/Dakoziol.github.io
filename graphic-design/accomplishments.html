        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but I’ve since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>This class is where I won bronze in the 2018 SkillsUSA Idaho banner contest and designed the CRTC logo they printed on shirts and keychains that year. Unfortunately, I don’t have either of the original pieces anymore, but I still have the bronze medal, a keychain, and a shirt.</p>

                <figcaption>This is a banner concept I came up with. It's only half finished, but I think it captures the vibe I'm going for so far: adventurous and intense, yet sort-of glammorous and prestegious.</figcaption>

                <img src="images/senior-project/concept-art/sketchy-jungle.png">
                <figcaption>This is the jungle terrain, the concept art that I've based the game on so far. It's also the cleanest looking terrain in my opinion.</figcaption>

                <img src="images/senior-project/concept-art/canyon.png">
                <figcaption>This is the canyon terrain, inspired by the Grand Canyon.</figcaption>

                <img src="images/senior-project/concept-art/archipelago.png">
                <figcaption>This is the archipelogo terrain. It's wide and there's no flowing water, so it's a lot different from the other concepts. It would probably need something else to make it interesting. Sharks?</figcaption>

                <img src="images/senior-project/concept-art/whitewater-forest.png">
                <figcaption>This is the pine forest terrain. The stream is narrow and rocky, treacherous in it's own right. Those are supposed to be pine trees; hopefully that'll be more obvious when they have parallax in-game.</figcaption>
