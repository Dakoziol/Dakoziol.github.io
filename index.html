        <h1><b>Dakoda Koziol</b>,<br> Computer Science Student<br> & Graphic Designer</h1>
        <h2>Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio.</h2>
        
        <p>In addition to my developing computer science education, I have an eye for graphic design.</p>
        <p>I'm excited to apply and develop both of these skills in a work environment, and ready to tackle new ones. Mostly, I want to have work that I can invest myself in, that I can be proud of.</p>

            <h2>Game Development in Unity Engine</h2>
            <p>I have been dabbling with Unity for a few years now. In fact, I built a mobile game for my high school senior project titled <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i>, a 2-D, top-down, local multiplayer kayak racing game. I even introduced myself to Git via Bitbucket and SourceTree for this project, but I still have a lot to learn with that. I’ve since started a few other projects, all very physics based, but I haven’t finished one yet. My web Authoring final project is also relevant as a showcase for <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i> and one of my later projects.</p>

            <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
            <p>In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but I’ve since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.</p>

            <h2>Front-end Web Development and Design</h2>
            <p>In this course I learned HTML and CSS, and some design tips. I especially got a solid understanding of and appreciation for responsive design. This very portfolio was built with skills I learned in that class, so go ahead and resize the window!</p>
            <p>Check out my final project&mdash;a hypothetical video game studio’s website&mdash;and my project management page to see how I progressed:</p>

            <h2>Computer Programming</h2>
            <p>While at CSI I’ve learned C++ and LC3 Assembly, though I already had experience programming with C# in Unity Engine before enrolling. Assignments were always task-oriented, and I often had to work with other students.</p>
            <p>I’m currently finishing up my Associates in Computer Science (and I nearly have an Associates in Mathematics as well). I plan on graduating with a C.S. degree at the end of this summer semester, and Mathematics in the fall.</p>
            <p>Check out my final C++ project below&mdash;a calculator that solves expressions obeying the order of operations by converting from in-fix notation to post-fix and solving that instead:</p>

            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>Writing isn’t my focus academically, but I don’t think I’ll disappoint if a job comes to it. I’ve taken English 102, Writing & Rhetoric, and have experience in expository, persuasive/argumentative, and narrative writing. Check out some of my more recent papers:</p>
