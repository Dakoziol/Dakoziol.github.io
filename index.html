        <h2>Hi, I'm Koda! Welcome to my Portfolio.</h2>
        
        <p>
            I'm a full-time Computer Science undergrad at Idaho State University, set to graduate in May 2024 and currently employed part-time in automation. With a focus on math and experience in graphic design, I could be a valuable, well-rounded addition to your team.

                While at CSI I learned C++ and LC3 Assembly, though I already had experience programming with C# in Unity Game Engine before enrolling. Assignments were always task-oriented, and frequently a collaboration. Check out my final C++ project below&mdash;a calculator that solves expressions obeying the order of operations by converting from in-fix notation to post-fix and solving that instead.

                For the final project in Advanced Object-Oriented Programming I was tasked to "make Space Invaders" in Windows Forms (C#). I put a lot of work into separating game logic from the engine logic, so now I have a really simple, scalable, display-agnostic game engine based on Windows Forms.

                In my Software Engineering course I was part of a semester-long group project: building a tower defense game with the <a href="http://almasb.github.io/FXGL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FXGL library</a>, which is based on JavaFX. We learned source control, continuous integration, unit testing, agile development, and other software engineering practices as we went along. Check it out below

                At Ibex Controls, I've been writing modbus polling software for getting sensor data from PLC's, managing websockets, a database, and user authorization/authentication with Django, and building out a React front-end for viewing live and historical data. I also learned a little bit of ladder logic so I could test all of this. I've been a critical part of the design and development of every part of the stack, from the front-end to the back-end to the polling program to the source-control paradigm.

            <h2>Game Development in Unity Engine</h2>
            <p>
                I have been dabbling with Unity for a few years now. In fact, I built a mobile game for my high school senior project titled <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i>: a 2-D, top-down, local multiplayer kayak racing game. This is also where I introduced myself to git. I've since started a few other projects, all very physics based, but I haven't finished one yet. My Web Authoring final project is also relevant as it happens to be a showcase for <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i> and one of my later projects.

            <p>
                In my junior and senior years of high school I took Graphics Communications at the Cassia Regional Tech Center in Burley, Idaho. There I was introduced to a bunch of Adobe Creative Cloud software and Maya 3D modeling software, but I specialized in Adobe Illustrator, and to a lesser extent Photoshop. I was Adobe Certified in both, but I've since switched to the Affinity Suite personally. I also learned and practiced typography and layout.

                In my Web Authoring course I learned HTML and CSS, and some design tips. I especially gained a solid understanding of and appreciation for responsive design.
