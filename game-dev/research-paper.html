        <h2>Game Development in Unity Engine</h2>
        <p>I have been dabbling with Unity for a few years now. In fact, I built a mobile game for my high school senior project titled <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i>: a 2-D, top-down, local multiplayer kayak racing game. I even introduced myself to Git via Bitbucket and SourceTree for this project, but I still have a lot to learn with that. I’ve since started a few other projects, all very physics based, but I haven’t finished one yet. My Web Authoring final project is also relevant as a showcase for <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i> and one of my later projects.</p>

            <h2>Research Paper</h2>
            <p>In this paper I analyze some popular, influential games and discuss game engines to make the point that game development today is more accessible than it’s ever been, specifically mobile game development. This was one of the easiest papers I’ve ever written. I analyze games myself all the time, I just had to put it on paper.</p>
            <p>If I were to update this paper for 2020, I’d have to include <em>PUBG mobile</em> and its control scheme. Between the gyro-aim and extremely configurable touch controls, the level of precision in the game approaches that of a mouse and keyboard, in my experience.</p>
