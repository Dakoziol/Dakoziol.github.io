        <h2>Game Development in Unity Engine</h2>
        <p>I have been dabbling with Unity for a few years now. In fact, I built a mobile game for my high school senior project titled <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i>: a 2-D, top-down, local multiplayer kayak racing game. I even introduced myself to Git via Bitbucket and SourceTree for this project, but I still have a lot to learn with that. I’ve since started a few other projects, all very physics based, but I haven’t finished one yet. My Web Authoring final project is also relevant as a showcase for <i>Kayak-O-Rama!</i> and one of my later projects.</p>

            <h2>Concept Art</h2>
            <p>The art of the <em>Kayak-O-Rama!</em> is inspired by vintage travel posters, hence the paper-like appearance in-game, and adventurous, eerily optimistic tone overall that I was going for. The terrain in every level consists of a stretch of water and its immediate ground, objects, and vegitation&mdash;all that a kayaker would see anyway. Everything's on a black background, which I think makes for a cool contrast especially on OLED displays.</p>

                <figcaption>This is a banner concept I came up with. It's only half finished, but I think it captures the vibe I'm going for so far: adventurous and intense, yet sort-of glammorous and prestegious.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This is the jungle terrain, the concept art that I've based the game on so far. It's also the cleanest looking terrain in my opinion.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This is the archipelogo terrain. It's wide and there's no flowing water, so it's a lot different from the other concepts. It would probably need something else to make it interesting. Sharks?</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This is the pine forest terrain. The stream is narrow and rocky, treacherous in it's own right. Those are supposed to be pine trees; hopefully that'll be more obvious when they have parallax in-game.</figcaption>
